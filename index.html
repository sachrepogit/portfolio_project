    I am working with an MNC as solution architect and take deep interest in learning new technologies. I have started my professional 
    career in year 2000. Initially I worked for a pharmaceutical company named Elysium. It was the largest medicine producer in India
    and were primarily selling the products to other MCN under their Brand.

    After working for almost 2 years, I left the company to persue MCA. After MCA, I worked for a small organization Kairus software in
    Gurugram. I left that after working for 3 months and then went to Bangalore to find my dream job. I land up in <a href="https://www.aztecsoftware.com/" target="_blank" >Aztec software</a>. In Aztec
    software I worked for 3 months, But as I was not satisifed with the job role and that is when I switched to <a href="www.oracle.com" target="_blank">Oracle India Pvt. Ltd.</a>
